Our winters are so variable with warm spells followed by extreme cold, at this point you might be better off waiting as described by the second FactSheet specific to Ohio. The optimal time for all grass seating is in September. Unless you have extensive bare spots or are willing to vigilantly water this coming summer. You might consider waiting until next early fall. https://extension.umn.edu/lawn-care/dormant-seeding   Winters with extended warm periods followed by extremely cold periods can negatively affect spring germination of dormant seeded lawns. Dormant seeding works best when you want to reseed bare soil areas or help thicken up thin lawns. It is not as effective where lawns are thick and dense because good seed-to-soil contact is necessary for the grass seeds to germinate and grow next spring. The time to dormant seed is important. If done too early, some seed will germinate late in the season and those immature seedlings often won\u2019t survive the winter. Put down your seed while the ground is not frozen, but is still cold enough so germination of the grass seed will not occur until next spring. Usually, this is from late October to mid-November depending on your location.  FactSheet 2 with information specific to Ohio in 2024: https://buckeyeturf.osu.edu/news/seed-establishment-fall  An excerpt: Dormant Seeding as an Alternative If the team decides it's too late for even fast-germinating species, dormant seeding offers another option. Dormant seeding involves applying seed that will not germinate until conditions improve in spring. Typically done in late winter (February-March), dormant seeding could also occur in late fall or early winter, provided a mulch or cover protects the seed from washing away. The aim is to prevent soil erosion over winter (Figure 4) and promote early germination in spring 2025, giving turf a head start as soon as conditions allow."

Just to clarify, it sounds like you\u2019re suggesting that dormant seeding should be done later in the winter, around February-March, as an alternative to mid-November seeding. This timing would allow the seeds to stay dormant until early spring, when they could start germinating with the warming soil. Since I live by myself, I'm hoping to do this with minimal effort, letting natural winter processes help settle the seeds into the soil. Will dormant seeding during late winter allow the earth's natural freeze-thaw cycle to work the seeds in effectively enough for early spring growth? When I do this in February, I don't need to worry about watering do I? Thank you again for your help!

Didn't get the sprinkler turned on, tree started looking pretty bad especially foliage on upper branches by late September/early October. The drought during early season may not have been the cause, perhaps the tree was already going to have a problem. I was told by a tree service company that may have looked at the tree it was lilac ash borer. I looked on the map provided in the bulletins(may have been dated)\u00a0while searching the data base for an answer, and read a couple other articles neither of these answered my questions: How to tell the difference between a lilac ash borer and an emerald ash borer? Does it matter in treatment? Is it possible to be rid of the borers? Will I have to treat every other year? Paid True lawn services to inject fertilizer into the drip line area in the ground around the tree. They have a. 5 & 7 treatment plan. I wasn't there for the first and the second sounds scammy. Some oil treatment sprayed on the tree and leaves (which were the first in the neighborhood to come down) to leave a waxy substance on the branches to suffocate the mites. Now I don't know I have mites and don't know if this is going to suffocate larvae. What stage would larvae be at. How long is the life cycle of the borer's?  The next two treatments are insecticide spraying in the spring and fertilizer. I like anyone else, do not like insecticides. I do not like this tree, perhaps I should get a different tree. I wasn't planning on uprooting a tree. I do love an evergreen tree over deciduous tree. It is a north facing exposure. I believe one insecticide is put directly into the trunk. \u00a0 Knew a little about pine beetles which seem to be the same type of bug, eats at the Cambian of the tree eventually kills the tree. has to be super cold for a long time to freeze the bugs, they can have more than one hatching as we are a warming climate. easily spreads, especially in wind. \u00a0 I'm willing to spend some money to have the tree sprayed twice but not without hard evidence this is the way to attempt to save the tree and control infestation in the FTC area. If it's a losing battle, I would replace with a lodgepole pine, Doug Fir or Spruce.\u00a0 Any information is helpful.  Kind regards,"

Fire blight can be difficult to control, but its severity also varies strongly with spring weather conditions (with cooler, wetter conditions typically favoring extensive infections).\u00a0\u00a0 Antibiotics are used as a preventative measure when the tree is flowering, applied every three to four days as a spray.\u00a0 If the tree has symptoms of fire blight, they are not recommended--they don't work well to control active infections in branches\u00a0and overuse in this situation can lead to antibiotic resistance of both the pathogen and other environmental bacteria.\u00a0 Some antibiotic products are not labeled for ornamental trees or non-orchard settings and so could not be used in a home landscape\u00a0in any case.\u00a0 The product label will specify use requirements. If your tree was impacted by fire blight this past year, pruning out visible cankers over the winter at least 18\" below the visible canker margin and spraying copper-based fungicides/disinfestants in the spring both before and during bud-break\u00a0can help limit the spread of the disease and are both more accessible and more effective options for home landscapes.\u00a0 Several copper-sulfate and copper-ammonium products are labeled for this use; be sure to read an follow all label directions for mixing and application--the label is the law. A tree-care professional could also apply growth regulators to your apple tree, which can harden twigs and make them less susceptible to infections.\u00a0 Minimizing over-watering and excess nitrogen fertilizer will also help to make the tree more resistant to bacterial growth. I hope this is helpful. Cordially, John"

Among the grasses, I'd plant rye or oats - the latter will cold kill, the former will hang on though out the winter. Grasses form dense root mats, which may be harder to work into the soil. Of course, I'm in the no-till crowd. If you are not, it should be not too much trouble.  Among the forbs, I'd try radish or beet - or arugula.   Whatever you sow at this time of year, sow PLENTY of seed, as the germination rates will be reduced."

Unfortunately\u00a0 I have been appointed resident gardener at this Assisted Living Facility by default because I am the only resident that can make it to the raised bed boxes in the cavernous backyard on a consistent basis This growing season we got a grant to construct new growing beds. The group is called growing Gardens, unique name. I am sure the person I am working with in that group is going to want to plant (Green manure) a cover crop that we can turn under if and when the soil dries in the spring.\u00a0 I have read that Alfalfa fixes the greatest amount of Nitrogen\u00a0 followed by the plants in the clover family. Which you suggested. The new grow\u00a0 boxes are a pattern growing gardens have perfected overthe years.

What I mean is that 1) the rainfall (over time) will reduce the P and K levels, and that 2) growing a crop and harvesting the crop is another means by which P and K are removed from the soil.  It's very nice that you were able to engage the local high school students to rebuild your beds.   It may well be that alfalfa is the most efficient legume at fixing nitrogen, but alfalfa is a perennial crop, with roots that can go to 12 feet - I would not recommend it for a raised bed. Further, this time of year is not right for planting alfalfa. It would be a waste of seed and you could expect very low germination. And it would be very difficult to turn under.  I continue to recommend the legumes stated yesterday. Either would be far easier to turn under than alfalfa.   Please write me next August and let's design a cover crop plan for these beds - you'll have time to access the seed you want and to get it planted and germinating before the cold and wet set in."

Knowing the type and fertility of your soil is the starting point to establishing & maintaining a strong turf that can resist diseases, weeds, moss and insects/grubs, look great and at an optimal cost. More info here: Don't Guess-Soil Test-MSU and MSU Home Soil Test-self mailer It provides recommendations on fertilization and pH changes if needed. \u00a0Phosphorous (P) is important for root development and flowering. \u00a0Too much phosphorous is detrimental to lakes and streams. \u00a0Potassium (K) promotes natural plant\u00a0resistance to disease, drought, cold and heat damage. Here is part of my confusion-you want better root growth (from phosphorous)\u00a0but you want to add more potassium (K) which doesn't affect root growth. Another way to increase root growth is to mow higher. \u00a0Read the articles in the attached links:\u00a0 Mowing Lawn Turf (E0013TURF) - MSU Why Mow High-MSU Root depth varies naturally between spring (deeper), summer (shallower) and fall \u00a0(deeper). \u00a0Do not fertilize too early in the spring as the nitrogen will force top growth at the expense of root growth. Bottom line.... \u00a0Do a soil test (if you haven't done one in the past 2 years), if the results indicate a need for phosphorous continue using your triple fertilizer and follow the test report fertilizing recommendations.\u00a0\u00a0If P is not needed, stop using the triple."

And, I\u2019m not sure how well you can see the extent of the problem from the photos, but perhaps they\u2019ll give you an idea.\u00a0If you have suggestions for things that would be palatable/good forage for sheep that gophers in particular don\u2019t like, and that we could overseed, we\u2019d appreciate the suggestions.\u00a0Thank you!CarlaOn Nov 4, 2024, at 3:03\u202fPM, Ask Extension wrote:"

There are registered, restricted-use products (primarily ZincPhosphide) that are labeled for in-burrow (i.e., hand-baiting) for both voles and gophers. Products such as zinc phosphide, strychnine, etc., are not species-specific -- So if you decided to treat the pasture prior to doing overseeding, you'd really want to be careful/thoughtful about\u00a0allowing your other animals and stock access to prospective contact (inhalation or ingestion) of the bait or ingestion of\u00a0animals containing the bait. This is part of\u00a0why these products\u00a0are restricted access & use, which means you either have to have a pesticide applicator license (many farm owner-operators do), or need to contract with somebody who is licensed and thus able to purchase and apply those products. One subgroup of qualified applicators would be those who are also trained and licensed as Wildlife Control Operators, so you might contact one or more and request a free estimate:\u00a0https://www.dfw.state.or.us/wildlife/license_permits_apps/wildlife_control_operator_contacts.asp"

It doesn't need to be open water, like tiny puddles that can harbor mosquito larvae, but it does need to be something damp, like residue lining a drain (for drain flies), organic matter below a house (for phorid flies), or fermenting fruits (for fruit flies), as several examples.

This allows the skin to thicken and can also allow bruises or small cuts to heal. Then you can move the potatoes to a fridge or other cool place (about 40 degrees) that is well-ventilated. Using perforated bags (like mesh or plastic)\u00a0with holes is a good choice.  Unfortunately, your potatoes will not store long-term and are likely to spoil. You can try eating them, but they probably won't taste great. Soaking them in water will not rehydrate them.  CSU Extension does have a fact sheet on growing potatoes.  From that publication: After harvest, the potatoes should be stored in a dark place with high humidity at 50 to 60F for about two weeks to cure, or set the skin. This can occur in a cooler part of the house, such as a utility room with a portable humidifier. The potatoes are then ready for long term storage in the dark at 40F, which prevents the potatoes from sprouting or shriveling due to moisture loss. The tubers should not be kept in sealed containers, but should be stored in burlap bags or slotted bins conducive to airflow. If they will be eaten within a week, potatoes can be stored at room temperature."

My first thought was some kind of fungal or bacterial disease affecting the vascular system.

I appreciate your help! \r\n\r\nI put in a new 1300 sq ft in-ground garden in May 2023 and did a soil test on 11/14/2023 and again on 10/28/2024 (see attached photos for the full reports). Since last year, I've had a large spike in phosphorus, which is now high. I added composted cow manure in May 2023 and again in April 2024, however, the composted cow manure that I obtained in 2024 contained quite a few animal bones (ew). Perhaps, that's where the high phosphorus came from? \r\n\r\nI'm cleaning up my garden and was preparing to add more compost this fall to replenish my garden (using the original composted cow manure with no animal bones), but now I'm stumped on a few things:\r\n1) Is the phosphorus high enough to where I should avoid adding compost this year? I know even bone-free compost contains a decent amount of phosphorus. I'm pleased to see that nearly all of my soil nutrients have increased from 2023, so perhaps skipping this year would be okay (minus the nitrogen - more on that in a minute)?\r\n2) If it's best for me to avoid adding compost, I feel like I still need to add something to continue my efforts to lighten up my heavy clay soil. I've read that adding sand isn't the best. Is there something else I could use? I use no-till methods and utilize a broadfork each spring to try to do some deep aerating and mulch throughout the growing season to encourage worm activity. I'm not afraid of trying expensive or labor-intensive ideas, so I'm open to anything you think might work :) \r\n3) Lastly, I'm stumped on my very low nitrogen levels, which are even lower than they were before. I added 24 lbs of blood meal (12-0-0) in April 2024. Should I add even more, or am I missing something here?\r\n\r\nI so appreciate your expertise!! I'm pretty stumped on what to do going forward. Thanks so much."

It\u2019s slimy and feels like pottery clay when wet and turns to a fine dust/powder when dry (I get puffs around my feet when walking).\u00a02) Oh, yes! Sorry about that, I just read the date off of the soil test report.

Otherwise, it might be weakened or dead/dying, in which case it would need to be pruned off. That might be hard to determine, though, until sometime next spring when it would be leafing back out again. What would have caused such dieback is hard to determine, but it might have been drought stress if the tree wasn't being regularly monitored for watering needs, given the drought this summer (and part of last year as well). We presume the mulch ring and trunk wrap\u00a0has prevented any lawn equipment from hitting the bark, since that can cause serious or fatal injuries to trees, but you can look for indications of trunk damage right around the soil/mulch level in case it hasn't been in place since the planting took place.  While nothing can be done to reverse any existing damage or dieback in the canopy, you can keep monitoring it for watering needs as it goes dormant, since leaf buds lying in wait for next year are relying on enough soil moisture to survive the winter, and roots can still be stressed or lost due to drought even if the canopy is bare for winter. Trees with canopy damage can replace lost growth eventually, though it might take a few years for a new leader to emerge from the regrowth.  Miri"

There are home spray products that have more specific and effective control than the general product you have been using. Just as important is timing your sprays effectively. You can use a tool like Enviroweather https://enviroweather.msu.edu/ to monitor conditions for specific pests and disease in your area based on weather conditions in addition to following the articles published in-season by our extension staff (for you the Northwest MI reports will be best) https://www.canr.msu.edu/fruit/  If you haven't done a soil test recently you should have one done, which would come with recommendations for fertilization.\u00a0https://homesoiltest.msu.edu/get-started  Your practice of keeping the orchard free from diseased fruit is one you should continue."

The way to best deal with that is to readjust what you think of as typical 'lawn', and plant salt-tolerant species\u00a0which can survive periodic inundation, which will surely happen again. These species of grass (or grass-like rushes) have some salt tolerance. Most will require full sun to thrive, and salt levels aside, some will also need better drainage than others.

Few species attain that size, and those that do tend to be members of the Sphinx (Sphingidae) or Wild Silk Moth (Saturniidae) families. The former tend not to have bristles or spines, save for a few horns (if any) on their bodies, so that leaves Saturniidae (also not generally densely spiny/bristly), or perhaps a caterpillar a bit smaller than the size you describe (like a Buck Moth, Tussock Moth, or Dagger Moth species larva, though those are not that big). The elliptical features you mention are probably the spiracles, which are breathing pores found on the sides of the body\u00a0in all insects, but which can take on this () appearance in caterpillars. While all caterpillars will have them in that general shape, they won't be prominent in some species.  Miri"

Instead, managing habitat to discourage rodents from visiting (by keeping firewood away from the house, for example, or not having bark mulch or leaf\u00a0mulched piled against the foundation) will be of more use, and sealing any gaps/cracks in exterior walls can also go along way towards keeping them out of a home. Snakes go where their prey is (and very much try to avoid conflicts with people), so by keeping mice or rats at bay, you're less likely to have snakes. (Though snakes are varied and several small species eat other things, like slugs/snails, worms, and insects, and are incapable of harming people.) Snakes are great pest control in home landscapes and it would be best to let them roam outside so they can consume pests before their populations become large. This includes rodents that can carry ticks that pick up Lyme Disease and other pathogens.  Most insects are not pests (for people or plants), and many actually are beneficial, helping to eat the insects that are pests. Insects that are pests take specific approaches to control, so they would need to be identified first. For example, mosquito control efforts would not be the same as for carpenter bees, so there is no single way to repel all of them. Broad-spectrum pesticides that kill a variety of insects also kill the beneficial ones, including pollinators (bees, butterflies), fireflies, and those that prey on pests.  Moles and voles are often confused for each other, as both make small holes in the soil and can create tunnels throughout parts of the yard. Moles eat worms, insects, and similar organisms; voles eat plant matter (roots, sometimes whole plants for perennials and annuals). Both tend to go away on their own in just a season or two because they are short-lived and prey for a variety of animals, including foxes, snakes, owls, and hawks. Do not use any poison baits to control them (because this can injure or kill those other animals), but if needed, lethal traps can capture moles and voles to reduce the population faster.

Considering that October has been warmer than normal, \u00a0grub activity could extend later into the fall before temperatures\u00a0cool enough for them to go into hibernation until spring. I have asked my local Consumer Horticultural Educator if he has heard/read anything. \u00a0No reply yet. \u00a0If he has a positive answer I'll pass it on to you in another email. I'm assuming if you are asking the question you think/know you have a grub problem. \u00a0Having a healthy turf is the first line of defense against grubs. \u00a0I recommend doing a soil test if you haven't done one in two years. You will learn more about your soil including soil type, pH, nutrient levels and more. Knowing the type and fertility of your soil is the starting point to establishing & maintaining a strong turf that can resist diseases, moss, weeds, insects/grubs and look great at an optimal cost.

What I'm curious about is what are the more precise conditions that these recommendations are communicating?  Are we looking for just enough time for the seeds to get to first or second leaf stage before dormancy?  Looking for soil that is under 60F and not likely to get warmer (preventing early germination)?  If one planted in, say, late November are we now risking a too-short cold stratification period? Or is there something else I'm missing entirely?  \r\n\r\nAnd, if this hasn't gone on too long already, is there a risk/reward balance on putting out seeds in fall vs spring?  Are seeds at higher risk of rot and predation than in the spring?  And, conversely are seeds at a higher risk of early spring heat and drying out along with spring grazers?\r\n\r\nFor context, I'm sowing a small patch of herbaceous perennials/bi-annuals to take up space as woody shrubs fill in.  The area has been under arborist chips for a couple seasons to smother existing weeds.  I plan on putting down about 1\" of topsoil on top of this patch to create a decent seedbed and top-dress with a thin layer peat moss for species that need one.  This area is not irrigated, so I want to give my seeds a good start to minimize time behind a hose.\r\n\r\nThank you for your time!"

Most of the literature about chill hours is about raspberries planted in the ground, but they can be successfully grown in containers. Since the recommended chill temps are 32-45F, it will depend on what variety of raspberry plant you have\u00a0(summer bearing or fall bearing). Hopefully you chose a hardier variety able to survive a cold winter even inside a garage. According to Penn State Extension, most raspberries need 80-100 chill hours to enter dormancy. Not knowing where you're located, I would make sure to bring in inside if you get a hard frost to protect your plant. I would also think your garage will provide your plant with enough chill hours to help it to become dormant. Here is an article explaining this further: Can Raspberry Plants Survive Frost in Winter?

The circular steel rings sit 1' above ground, are 38\" around, and have approximately 8\" of compost-enriched soil.  At this point in our Zone 4 growing season, I understand that perennials might not have adequate time to root and survive to return in spring. \r\n\r\nI'm reluctant to remove the rings and dig newer plants directly in the ground near the honeylocust for fear of disturbing the tree's roots. \r\n\r\nHowever, a local garden center currently has MN native plants (eg, columbine, short aster, sedge, figwort) and Zone 3-5 perennials (eg hosta, heuchera) at bargain prices ($2.50-$6) that I'm tempted to give that mixture a try in the raised beds.  \r\n\r\nIf it would be helpful for me to upload an image of the front yard w/steel rings, I can do so. \r\n\r\nThank you for your expert consideration!"

Apologies for the slight delay in responding - we just received the copy yesterday.  Regarding the optimal turf grass length, it's best to select the highest height you find suitable in appearance - this is generally around 3 inches. Lawns cut shorter than this will have shorter and less prolific root systems. You can also leave clippings on the lawn to add nitrogen back to the soil, which can minimize the need to add other fertilizers.  Excessive phosphorus, potassium, and magnesium should not cause detrimental effects to your lawn. It's a good idea to be aware of the levels as you have don't with this soil test and reduce application of additional nutrients. It's worth mentioning that excessive phosphorus can cause environmental issues when runoff enters waterways. Considering a few of your nutrients are high or excessive, you can plan not to add any additional fertilizer or compost to your lawns. You can test again next season to see if any adjustments are needed."

        "text": "The drought status many Maryland counties experienced this past summer was intense enough to have killed some lawn grasses, rather than just induce dormancy. If the lawn wasn't able to be irrigated periodically in your absence, that might have been the cause of dead zones within the lawn. An outbreak of disease (Brown Patch being one possibility) can't be ruled-out, but most areas were so dry that a fungal issue was less likely.  The only option if no new growth has appeared by now (or, really, a few weeks ago) is to re-seed or re-sod those patches. Dead grass should be raked off and seed or sod put down as needed. However, since we are into the second half of October, it's a bit late to try seeding, as the seedlings might not have enough time to establish by the time nights freeze and the days get too short to support growth. If you try seeding, put down seed as soon as possible and monitor them carefully for watering needs, as seed is intolerant of drying out for long during the germination and establishment phases. Covering seeded areas with row cover might give them a few degrees of temperature insulation that can help them catch up on growth. A safer bet this late into lawn season, though, is to put down sod instead. It will also need attention to watering as it roots in, but at least it saves you time in getting new grass established before it gets too cold and we have too little daylight. Maryland Certified Sod will have the best quality, if it's still available.  For the future, we don't recommend the use of weed &\u00a0feed products since they necessitate putting down fertilizer and herbicide at the same time, which doesn't allow you to customize each to what the lawn actually needs. A laboratory soil test will help determine what nutrients the lawn might be lacking (if any), which also determines which type of fertilizer (with or without phosphorus) is legal to use, as Maryland has a lawn fertilizer law that restricts phosphorus use only to lawns whose soil test shows a deficiency. This limits stormwater and Bay pollution, though it also is cost-saving since you're not applying a nutrient the lawn doesn't need if phosphorus levels are sufficient as-is. Soil testing also evaluates acidity (pH), in case lime applications would benefit the lawn. The latest legal date for fertilizer application is Nov. 15, so that leaves little time to apply one fertilization to new seed or sod if it's sown/laid late, though the nutrients from the prior fertilization might suffice without adding more.  To determine which herbicides (if any) are best to use (and at what timing)\u00a0for lawn weeds, the weed ID needs to be determined first. You can explore our lawn weed web pages to find the species most commonly causing problems in lawns, or you can send us photos for ID if you can't find a match. A healthy, vigorous, dense lawn will need little in the way of herbicide application, since the turf will out-compete most weeds before they get a chance to establish.  The holes in the Hosta foliage look like classic slug/snail damage; Hostas are a favored food for them, among other annuals and perennials. No intervention is needed this season since the plants will soon be going dormant, but information on the linked page can help you minimize damage in future summers.  Miri"

We don't see a product online listed by the name FastGrass...did you mean Scotts Rapid Grass instead? (Of which there are several different formulations, so we still don't know which exact one you are referring to.)  The proportions of grass seed type will be listed on the bag for each option on the market. The Scotts products that we think you are referring to\u00a0are probably not customized to be locally-proven varieties for the Mid-Atlantic, with our challenging growing conditions for turf,\u00a0though you can cross-check what varieties the label does include with the recommended turfgrass cultivars on the linked UMD publication. Ideally, you want as many cultivars as possible in the bag to be included on that published list.  Quick-to-germinate filler in some seed blends tends to be perennial ryegrass, which you do not want in proportions higher than 5 to 15% of the mix due to its greater disease susceptibility compared to tall fescue. We would suspect that a seed blend advertising rapid growth uses a higher amount of ryegrass, but it's hard to tell as we can't look up the product label.  The web page Lawn Fertilizer Schedule that we shared previously lists the application rate (based on nitrogen) and recommended application times of year, so a spring application would be made around\u00a0May, if it's needed. The Winter Survival product you mention looks like it has zero phosphorus [P], which is good (and legally required unless a lawn soil test shows a P deficiency). It could be applied now if the lawn needed a boost and if the weed-and-feed you already applied has had enough time to work. (How many weeks ago was it applied? If it was just\u00a0earlier this month, then the lawn probably does not need another dose of any fertilizer before the Nov. 15 cutoff date.) You'll still need to apply it at a dose compliant with the lawn fertilizer schedule, so too much nitrogen [N] isn't applied at once (no more than 0.9 lb. per 1,000 sq. ft. of total nitrogen per application).

At the time I was not aware of the toxicity of milkweed to certain livestock. I'm now looking at the prospect of either having to sort through a large amount of hay for dried milkweed or having to destroy the hay. We feed this hay to Nigerian dwarf goats, two horses (one mini), and two mini donkeys. How toxic is the milkweed common in west Michigan when it has been dried and baled? In other words can I sort out the majority of it and be ok, or because its very toxic and baling crushes some of the leaves which find their way into the rest of the hay, the hay should probably be destroyed and not fed to livestock.

Does the milkweed toxin build up in animals over time, or does their body get rid of it over time? Thank you again, Mike!

Transplanting the small trees should be fairly simple, however, to ensure the highest chance of success it would be beneficial to root prune this fall and move the trees in the spring of 2025. If these trees are indeed root suckers, then the likelihood they have a deep taproot is very low, but you would want to get the largest rootball possible to include the largest number of lateral roots. They make shovels designed for root pruning, but most long round spades should work fine. Root pruning should be done as soon as possible to allow the tree more time to develop roots within the rootball zone, which is dependent on the size of the trees.\u00a0 The general rule is\u00a0a minimum of\u00a012 inches in diameter for trees in inch or less in trunk diameter.\u00a0\u00a0For each additional inch of trunk diameter at chest height (if it is that tall), add\u00a0another 12 inches to the rootball zone diameter. However, the rootball size for the 9 ft trees can quickly become unreasonable for a DIY project and may require a professional with a tree spade. I would recommend a minimum of a 36\" diameter rootball for a 9 ft tree, which could easily weigh 1000 lbs. For the larger tree, they might consider attempting to bare-root transplant the tree in the spring to minimize weight concerns. An airspade can be rented, or hand excavation in conjunction with a pressurized water stream can also be effective for bare-rooting the trees.\u00a0 Roots can then be followed and severed cleanly with a sharp pair of pruners. Moving a bare-rooted tree will be much easier compared to a large root ball with soil. I hope this is helpful.  --  I've also attached an article from Penn State\u00a0Extension\u00a0with some information on root pruning and more for transplanting trees and shrubs from one location to another.  So, to summarize, it seems best to wait until early spring.\u00a0 However, the root pruning can and should be done immediately.\u00a0 The simplest method is to use a round spade and cut straight down in a circular pattern around the rootball zone.\u00a0 A trench method is also described in the attached article, but that may take more time, effort, and materials.\u00a0 When transplanting next spring, be sure to cut just outside your root prune cut so you capture the new feeder roots without damaging them.\u00a0 For the larger tree, you might consider having it moved by a professional with a tree spade, or taking the time to expose bare roots that can be cut and the tree moved as a bare root transplant.\u00a0 This would still require several people, perhaps some machinery, and some caution to move safely.  I hope this helps.\u00a0 Please let me know if you have any follow-up questions.   Regards, Talon Becker Illinois Extension"

They chew on roots and bulbs, leading to dying patches in the lawn. They feed on vegetation, roots and seeds. Grubs (the larvae of beetles like Japanese beetles or chafer beetles) feed on grassroots, causing large brown patches that can be easily lifted because the roots are destroyed. Grubs are more likely to cause lawn damage in the spring and early summer.  From the photo it looks like there are tunnels and molehills in your yard which are characteristic signs of moles. So I suspect moles are causing the problem. Moles can be controlled using repellants, baits or traps. I am including a factsheet on moles which describes their activities and controls in more detail. Sometimes both moles and voles are present at the same time so I am also sending a factsheet on voles. Also with moles once they have exhausted their food supply in a yard they will move on. If you use a pesticide to control them please read and follow the directions on the label for effectiveness and safety. \u00a0It is probably too late in the year for traditional reseeding of your yard. \u00a0But there is a practice called dormant seeding (seeing over winter) which might be something for you to consider. \u00a0It gets the grass started sooner next spring. \u00a0Look over the factsheet and see if it might be a fit for you.\u00a0 And one more factsheet on the best trufgrass types for Ohio (yeah we like factsheets). You can take the turfgrass sheet to a garden center to get a good seed mix for your area. Thank you for using Ask Extension. Moles Voles Dormant Deeding Turfgrass for Ohio"

Sod webworms will typically overwinter in your yard and so can be a problem in the same areas they were in this past year. This is somewhat uncommon for insects as many will fly elsewhere.\u00a0 You will likely need to apply an insecticide that is targeted at the webworms.\u00a0A few insecticides that are good for this include Capture, Mustang, and Lorsban. Before you apply these insecticides, heavily water your yard (1/2 inch of water) to bring the caterpillars close to the surface. You will also want to cut the grass a bit lower than you typically do to remove most of the canopy and get the insecticide closer to where the caterpillars are. I am attaching a link for a\u00a0good article on this topic from the University of Nebraska Department of Entomology. Good luck!Robby https://entomology.unl.edu/turfent/documnts/swebwrms.shtml"

For measuring with your scale, I\u00a0use two glass jars like I\u00a0showed at the class and just alternate between them. Glass is fine to use on a scale, just be sure to tare it out after you put the jar on the scale, otherwise you'll have to do the quick math of the weight of the jar plus the starter, flour and water.  My process goes something like this- Grab my scale and my clean jar. Place clean jar on scale and tare it. This should leave you with zero on the scale. I then take my starter from the last feeding, mix it up a bit, and measure out 113g right into the clean jar on the scale. If you accidentally put a little to much in, just scoop it back out until you're close to 113g.  Then, I\u00a0tare it again and using a small scoop, I scoop my flour into the jar until it reaches 113g (give or take a gram or two). At this point, I\u00a0have 113g of starter and 113g of flour in the jar. Next, I'll take that off the scale and get two measuring cups. I use silicone measuring cups because they're easy to pour. The first one, I'll put on the scale and tare it. The other I put about a half cup of water in and then pour into the measuring cup on the scale until it reaches 113g. Then I'll pour that into the starter/flour mixture and mix it all up until smooth. I hope that isn't confusing! Please ask if you have more questions!"

        "text": "Hello Margaret, Many years ago, I discovered this lovely, spiked purple flower growing in my garden. I didn't plant it, so I thanked the birds for dropping the seeds of this flower. It wasn't until a few years later when I was taking MSU Master Gardener training that I learned I had purple loosestrife. Even though I didn't live near a river or lake, I was told that\u00a0I should remove it from my garden because of its aggressive behavior and impact on other plants.  A question for you: You didn't provide a photo, so are you sure it's purple loosestrife? Some plants mimic it.\u00a0How did it get in your garden? How long have you had it? You probably didn't purchase this in a nursery. This plant is restricted in Michigan.  The following\u00a0definition of purple loosestrife is from the MISIN (Midwest Invasive Species Information Network). The MISIN keeps track of invasive species in the Midwest. Description: This species is restricted under Michigan law; attractive but persistent weed; spreads vigorously in moist soil conditions; crowds out native wetland plant species. https://www.misin.msu.edu/facts/detail/?project=misin&id=32&common=Purple+loosestrife  If a species is prohibited or restricted, it is unlawful to possess, introduce, import, sell or offer that species for sale as a live organism, except under certain circumstances.\u00a0 https://www.michigan.gov/invasives/id-report/prohibitedrestricted  Purple loosestrife reproduces mostly by seed. Each stem of the plant contains about 200,000 tiny seeds. Since the plant may contain at least 5 - 10 stems, a single plant can produce over 1 million seeds a year. These seeds can stay dormant in the soil for years.\u00a0  The following is from Penn State Extension: \"The tiny seeds, about the size of ground pepper, are transported by water, wind, and feathers and fur of aquatic birds and mammals. Seeds that stick to muddy footgear, boats, boat trailers and vehicle treads can travel far from the original site to spread this purple menace.The seeds may remain viable for many years when submerged, waiting for the opportunity to sprout. Suddenly, during a dry summer, the seeds may germinate. Seed production, dispersal and germination are so effective that young seedlings can completely replace native vegetation.\"\u00a0\u00a0https://extension.psu.edu/purple-loosestrife-in-pennsylvania  Finally, if you wish to keep this plant in your garden, read this from MSU Extension:  \"If managing purple loosestrife in a location, monitoring the flowering progress can be helpful when deciding about control. Pulling plants before they are done blooming and begin producing seeds can help prevent them from spreading. Purple loosestrife can reproduce asexually from cuttings or pieces of rootstock. Due to this, it is best to burn the pulled plants or dispose of them in closed plastic bags in the trash. If treating with a foliar herbicide, treating after peak bloom around August can be effective. Permits are often required when using an herbicide near bodies of water to help ensure proper use and protection of our water resources.\u00a0Visit the EGLE website for more information.\"\u00a0\u00a0 https://www.canr.msu.edu/news/drive-by-botany-purple-loosestrife-and-spotted-knapweed  I hope this information is helpful, but please don't hesitate to contact us again if you have questions or need more information.  Have a great fall!"

People often mistake sawfly larva for caterpillars, which they are not so the usual treatment of Bt spray (Bacillus thuringiensis) that is used for caterpillar control isn't effective.  Luckily, birch sawfly populations are inconsistent from year to year so even if they do significant damage one year, they likely won't be back the next.\u00a0 Have a look at this article from UVM Extension- https://www.uvm.edu/news/extension/dusky-birch-sawflies Because of the low risk of plant mortality, we generally don't recommend chemical control for this insect pest. If they do return in the spring or summer, there are a couple of more natural ways to control that are proven to be effective. These are insecticidal soaps and horticultural oil sprays which should be used when the larva are still young and small.   I hope this helps and please ask if you have any further questions!"

Jams and jellies with standard pectin will not jell correctly without sugar, so it\u02bcs not recommended to remove the sugar from those recipes. Pickled vegetables: You can remove the sugar from a recipe and have a safe pickle. That said, you\u02bcll likely have better tasting pickles if you use one of the recipes with no sugar in them to begin with. Recipes with a small amount of sugar (tablespoons) will also taste fine if the sugar is removed, but \"sweet\" pickle recipes with no \"sweet\" in them might not taste as good. Low acid recipes that require pressure canning for safety can have sugar safely removed. If there are any specific recipes you are interested in (or concerned about) adapting to remove sugar, let me know and I can take a look. Otherwise, it\u02bcs not generally difficult to adapt your canning to be sugar free. Sarah"

The drought from earlier in summer that affected much of the state is ongoing in many areas (see linked map, which is updated weekly).  Adding organic matter like compost is a good way to improve the moisture-holding capacity of the soil. A shovel-full, more or less, will probably suffice for the average shrub in terms of root ball size. Avoid over-amending as this can set the plant up for stress later as the roots expand out from the original planting hole, though you could still top-dress the soil surrounding the plant with about an inch of compost, plus a couple inches of an organic mulch (bark, wood chips, etc., that biodegrades) that will itself compost into more organic matter over time. This will keep the soil well-amended over the long term, as soil life works that layer into the root zone naturally.  After planting (even if there was no drought), monitor the plant for watering needs so it establishes well and maintains a vigorous root system. The linked page provides guidance for how to water and how to\u00a0determine when watering is needed.  Miri"

I am loathe to do so now. \u00a0I have many species of birds, deer, rabbits, squirrels, raccoons and more in my yard.

Is there any concerted effort to protect them?

Treating all ash in riparian zones is not feasible, so I\u00a0know a lot of cities/counties are selecting individual trees to try to protect. You may consider reaching out to the city or county to see if they have a public plan yet. I do not know about the Oak Creek development as I had nothing to do with that process.

My neighbors do not seem to have this problem and they have wood homes too.\r\n\r\nThere are a few photos that show the full house front exterior. The holes are not the tree at all. There are no trees in the back where the hole was chewed near the deck; there is a tree next to the shed (forgot to get that photo). Two holes have been on the front side, on the garage wall that faces the front porch. One hole was on the back of the house, where the chimney box meets the deck. The fourth hole was on the doorframe of the shed. \r\n\r\nI am really close to losing my mind because I can't figure out how to stop this. The holes are made very quickly--like overnight. So now every morning I have to walk around the house and check for holes! And of course, that is only part of the problem. I still have to get the critters out. I have four traps set in my attic but they are managing to avoid them. Unless they've gone out from another hole I can't see!\r\n\r\nIn addition, if anyone has an idea on how to get rid of the squirrels, that would be great too. I have tried SO many things...\r\n\r\nMaybe this could be some student's phd thesis project! lol\r\n\r\nThanks for ANY help.\r\n\r\nAndi B"

I have two suggestions: 1). If possible, try to get a picture of the presumed termite and send to us. We should be able to provide some form of identification. 2). Get assessments and estimates from two other exterminating services. As University of Minnesota Master Gardeners, we cannot make recommendations for commercial enterprises. However there are several businesses in your county so you should have no problem in obtaining additional estimates. Good luck!! Please get back to us with any additional, related questions."

Unfortunately, this is not our departments area of expertise. Possibly Forestry may be able to help you with identifying wood type and woodland creature habits. You can find their link below. Best of luck! https://www.canr.msu.edu/forestry Windie Canen Secretary <personal data hidden> From: andi bee <<personal data hidden>>  Sent: Tuesday, October 1, 2024 12:24 PM To: Geological Sciences <<personal data hidden>> Subject: wood question Hello. I am 99 percent certain I am not asking the right people, but I have to start somewhere! I am trying to find someone who might be able to shed some light on what about the exterior of my house is making it attractive to squirrels, which have taken to chewing through very rapidly. It is wood, but many of my neighbors (I live in the city of East Lansing; neighbors are very close) have wood homes as well and have not experienced this. I thought the wood was cedar but now I am not sure; wondering if perhaps it is wood that was not meant to be outside (was on the house when I purchased it 11 years ago)? I checked the moisture level and it was 10.5, which from what I have read, is not problematic. Do squirrels eat carpenter ants? I had those in one area where they had chewed but had an exterminator take care of that. Maybe the ants are in the new area... An orange size hole is sealed up and the next morning, a new one of that size is right next to it. This has happened several times in the past year. I am at a loss of what to do, short of ripping the siding off the entire house and installing steel siding.  Two construction/builders have looked at it and cannot determine what is wrong; they tell me to throw rat poison into the hole and seal it up. But that doesn't prevent the new one holes. I've talked to several critter places and they say they will come out and find the hole then close it. Well, I can see the hole because it is not even close to being hidden, so they are not the right people either. ANY suggestions of who I might talk to you would be SO appreciated.  Thank you for any help or for passing this on to someone who might have ideas."

I can answer your walnut tree question\u2014 bottom line is no, unless you can find a wood working\u00a0Hobbyist who has a portable sawmill, two trees are typically not cost effective to take down for the wood. There are a lot of factors to consider. Value of the trees will depend on the species, size, and condition. The number of trees, ease of removal and access to a mill are also factors. Best bet is to contact a local logger. You can look in the yellow pages or search online   Taking down trees is the most dangerous function in the arborist and tree service repertoire. Be sure whoever is removing your trees has professional status and\u00a0insurance coverage.\u00a0\u00a0You can find certified arborists here\u2014 http://www.treesaregood.org You can find professional landscape companies here\u2014.\u00a0 http://plantmichigangreen.com/aws/MNLA/pt/sp/home_page ; There is an Urban Wood\u00a0group who may have someone interested in buying the wood once the trees re down\u2014 https://urbanwoodnetwork.org/chapter/michigan-state-chapter/   For your second question about squirrels, would you please enter a new question for that, and include\u00a0a picture of the siding and one of the whole house taken far enough back so the overhanging trees can be seen, too.

However, without the cultivar name (there are approximately 8 varieties), it is difficult to determine how plentiful the production of shoots will be. Perhaps the nursery where you originally purchased the shrubs may be able to provide the cultivar name.\u00a0 \u00a0Pruning cuts trigger a physiological response in plant cells which affects bud dormancy and branching habits. It will take at least three years to get the plants to have a bushier habit. Before you begin, take a good look at the plant and select about one third of the branches, divided evenly all over the plant. Cut the chosen branches back by 1/4 to just above an outward facing bud. The following year you can then remove half the branches that were left the last time, and in the third year all the remaining branches can be tackled. The best time to prune is when the plant is fully dormant in late fall.\u00a0 \u00a0Some key points to keep in mind : use sharp appropriately-sized bypass pruners to prevent bruising. Make sure to sterilize pruners with each cut, apply water and fertilizer in spring, and regularly check your plant for insects and diseases, such as powdery mildew, so that these may be treated early....\"    hope this helps"

Depending on the rose type you may not need to do anything. You should wait to cut back roses until leaf drop or in md to late winter and remove dead, diseased, damaged branches first. If your rose is planted in an open site that gets a lot of wind and is grafted, you can pile mulch over the graft to help stabilize it for the winter and fluctuating temperatures."

This mast year has smothered my lawn that suffers due to tree roots, blocked sun,  trees that absorb nutrients, fallen branches, and squirrels digging up my lawn.

If so, how many pounds of acorns, how often, and how long do I need to surround the base of my oak tree with acorns? Will it work if put the acorns on top of myrtle? Besides mowing the lawn (not the lowest setting or it will damage grass roots), and possibly a wet/dry vacuum (not commercial), do you have any suggestions for acirn removal and prevention? My oak tree is beautiful, but it's becoming very difficult to take of my lawn, because I am disabled and I can't afford lawn service. Thank you."

Burnt out grasses have been a problem in Northeast Ohio especially if you have not been watering the lawn throughout the drought that we\u00a0have been experiencing.\u00a0  If the grasses are browned out and nothing is growing underneath, as you suggest, I would recommend removing all dead grasses and reseeding those areas.   This source talks about choosing the right turf grass for your area: https://erie.osu.edu/sites/erie/files/imce/Program_Pages/ANR/Choosing%20right%20turfgrass%20for%20Ohio%20lawn.pdf   This site has great information on the proper mowing of various grasses in Ohio: https://ohioline.osu.edu/factsheet/hyg-5816  Take a look at your Scott's 4 Step bag - it should give you information regarding the proper use and timing of application in regard to newly seeded lawn areas.  In regard to ridding your lawn of Bermuda grass, I have attached the following website which deals with that specific question.\u00a0\u00a0 https://www.peoplesdefender.com/2021/06/26/time-to-control-invasive-bermudagrass/  Best of luck to you as you ready your lawn for winter!"

The pushing of sap is an attempt to flush out the intruder. You can learn more about this and other issues these trees can have at our publication here:\u00a0 https://extension.umd.edu/resource/ornamental-cherry-trees-identify-and-manage-problems/ Unfortunately, once borers are within a tree, there is not a lot that you can do, though you can often prolong its life by trying\u00a0to keep the tree less stressed overall.  Do we see landscape fabric stretched over the root area, including on the big root off to the right? We'd remove/cut out all of that that you can.\u00a0  With climate change, growing conditions have changed, and in the last couple of years, there have been prolonged high heat and serious drought conditions. Pull any weeds around the tree and give it a layer of mulch no deeper than 2 to 3 inches, kept pulled back from contract with the trunk. Offer it water when we don't get an inch of rain per week. Here is our watering information:\u00a0 https://extension.umd.edu/resource/watering-trees-and-shrubs/  Ornamental cherry trees often start to decline after 20 years or so, but you can keep it as long as you like if it pleases you, especially with blooms in the spring and colorful fall leaves.  I had one that slowly declined for many years, losing limbs one by one.

I noticed a lot of ants along a 4ish foot stretch of the bed, they were one and under the wood after we removed the plank. I think they are winged carpenter ants but I'm not sure. Since it's the end of the season I didn't noice any plant damage and from my research it doesn't seem like they eat many plants. I'm wondering if we should be concerned and need to intervene in any way, or if you think the problem will resolve itself. There are kids who come to the garden and I don't know if they will spread rapidly. Do you think if we replace the wood, should that wood be treated or untreated or does it not matter. There was construction going on very close to the garden, so that may have factored into them surfacing.  I can't seem to upload the pic for some reason, and not sure how important it is to determine which species it is or if all ants would require the same action.  Thanks!"

Black sooty mold is a fungus that colonizes the excrement (honeydew) of aphids. The mold itself is generally not considered damaging, though it can prevent the plant from photosynthesizing if it is covering most of the plant.\u00a0 You can wash the black sooty mold off of the plant using a strong water spray. This works better if the sooty mold has only been there for a short while. The best long term control of the black sooty mold is controlling the aphids themselves. There are many natural enemies of aphids such as ladybugs and lacewings. If these are not controlling the aphids well enough, you will need to use an insecticide. Most insecticides will kill aphids quite easily. I would recommend using something with the active ingredients of pyrethrin or pyrethrum as these are organic and will break down quickly in the environment - not killing as many beneficial insects. Good luck! Robby"

Some reasons for the lack of blooms on the Hydrangea:  - Improper pruning (Which includes \u201cpruning\u201d by deer. Deer love to graze on the leaves and tender tips),  - Cold damage which kills flower buds but not necessarily leaf buds, and - Over fertilizing (adding too much nitrogen) which provides for lush foliage but does not increasing flowering.  Since I don\u2019t know the variety of hydrangea you\u2019re growing, it could also be improper placement. Some varieties grow best in morning sun with afternoon shade.  Some varieties produce flowers on wood generated the previous season, so if you prune your shrub back in the spring- you'd get healthy leaf growth, but no flowers.  Some \u201cnewer\u201d variety hydrangea, which came to market in the early 2000\u2019s (example -\"Endless Summer\") were propagated to have the ability to bloom not just on the previous year\u2019s wood, but also on new wood.  Hydrangeas that bloom on old wood and are affected by cold damage (spring frosts or freezes) may have killed any buds that were present. These shrubs lose the ability to tolerate frost once the plant breaks dormancy.  Remember not to overfertilize as this will promote gorgeous foliage at the expense of flowering.  Guide to pruning hydrangeas (with good photos)\u00a0Pruning hydrangeas for best bloom | UMN Extension  I do hope this information has been helpful! And with a little assistance, next season your hydrangea should be in full bloom."

        "text": "Hello Judy,  Usually, leaf spots on houseplants are minor and don't require treatment, but it would help us to make a diagnosis if we can see the symptoms. Are you able to send a few photos with your reply? (You can attach image files or paste images directly into the body of your reply. Please use files at least 1MB in size so we can enlarge them if needed.)  When you say you added potting soil, do you mean that extra potting soil was put on top of the container's existing soil, or that the plant was repotted by replacing the old potting soil? Old potting soil can gradually accumulate minerals from tap water and unused fertilizer nutrients, and over time this can stress roots. Because of this, and since old potting soil also tends to drain more poorly over time, when repotting a plant (even if it doesn't need a change in pot size), it's best to remove as much old potting soil as possible and replace it with fresh. How often to do this depends on a few factors, but generally, every year or two should be fine.  Leaf yellowing can indicate a few issues, including over-watering, under-watering, too much light, too little light (not as likely outside as compared to growing indoors), or a need for fertilizer. Was the plant fertilized this past summer? And is the soil being allowed to get fairly dry at least an inch down into the soil before the plant is watered again? If the soil is kept too damp, the roots might be suffocating (in a sense) and not working properly, which can lead to leaf yellowing and shedding.  Does the pot have drainage holes, and if so, is any saucer it's placed on emptied promptly after watering? If not, pooled water can seep back into the drain holes and keep the roots too wet.  These are some initial thoughts as to why symptoms often develop on houseplants (whether they're indoors year-round or outside for the summer), but with photos, we can try to narrow the diagnosis down.

        "speaker": "expert",
        "text": "In the absence of any photographs, I can only offer the most likely reasons for you Boxwood plants turning yellow. Yellowing leaves do not necessarily signal that your shrub is dead. But they are concerning because they mar the appearance, at least temporarily, of a plant valued for the beauty of its delicate, leathery, rich green foliage.  The good news is that there is usually a way to fix the problem of boxwood turning yellow. Following are some of the reasons boxwoods turn yellow and suggestions for how to fix it. The fix is different for each, so it's important to detect the reason in your particular case. Once you have fixed the underlying problem that caused their foliage to yellow, then all you can do is wait for them to green up again.  Fungal DiseasesRoot rot and boxwood blight are fungal diseases that attack boxwood. Root rot is caused by fungal pathogens in the soil. As with all fungal problems, it is most prevalent where the soil is overly wet.  To avoid having your boxwoods turn yellow due to root rot (or to keep the problem from getting any worse), make sure: --- You don't overwater, and--- The soil drains well. Boxwoods often harbor boxwood blight when they are being grown at the nursery. When you bring your plants home, you can accidentally spread them by shearing your shrubs in wet weather. This transports the disease from plant to plant. When you shear boxwoods, frequently disinfect your shearing tools with a disinfectant such as bleach to prevent spreading the disease. Shear them only on dry days.  Winter DamageAlthough this is unlikely in our case because you mention that they looked great all summer, it is possible for boxwood leaves to turn a coppery or yellowish color during a Northern winter. This is caused by exposure to wind and sun, which dry the plant out at a time when, due to the frozen ground, water is not readily available to it.  To prevent this \"winter burn,\" spray an anti-desiccant on your boxwood in late November and again in late January. Alternatively, wrap your boxwood in burlap. Salt Damage This condition is also unlikely, as you report that your plants looked great all summer and it is not yet winter. However, you do not mention exactly where your boxwoods are planted, so the following may be helpful information to not. If your boxwoods are planted along the road, they could suffer salt damage during the winter in the North. You'll notice yellowing leaves come spring. When the salt gets on the leaves, it can dry them out. The salt can also get into the soil, keeping your shrubs from absorbing water properly.  Covering your plants isn't sufficient in this case since you wouldn't be able to keep the salt from getting into the soil. The only fix here is to choose a different planting location for your boxwoods. Alternatively, grow salt-tolerant plants along the road.  Dog UrineAnother cause of boxwoods turning yellow is stray dogs urinating on them. This happens because urine contains excessively high concentrations of nitrogen. Use repellents to keep stray dogs out of your yard. PestsBoxwoods are attacked by pests such as leaf miners and scale. Serious infestations can result in boxwoods turning yellow. Faithfully inspect your plants for pests, particularly the undersides of the leaves. If you find any pest activity, the articles at the close of this response will provide information about what to so. TipPerform \"the scrape test\" to see if your boxwood is dead. With a sharp knife, scrape off a bit of the bark on one of the branches. If what you see underneath is yellowish-green, that branch is alive; if brown, it's dead. Repeat on all the branches with yellow leaves. Prune out the branches you've determined to be dead. If you've pruned out the vast majority of the branches, it's probably time to replace the plant. More Tips about Growing Health Boxwoods:Despite all the various factors that can cause your boxwood's leaves to turn yellow, boxwood is not an especially hard plant to grow. Nor is it high maintenance unless you will be trimming it in a hedge. Here are a few tips to follow to keep your boxwoods healthy: --- Boxwoods are best planted in full sun in the North, partial shade in the South.--- Give your shrub a loamy soil that drains well.--- Locate it where it will be sheltered from winds.--- Boxwood roots are shallow, which can expose them to excessive heat. Put a layer of organic garden mulch, 3 inches thick, around your plant to give it protection from the heat. Following are a few articles which may help you determine what to do:https://www.canr.msu.edu/news/browning-of-boxwood-is-it-boxwood-blighthttps://www.canr.msu.edu/news/boxwood_insect_pestshttps://www.canr.msu.edu/news/boxwood-blight-disease-identified-in-michiganhttps://www.canr.msu.edu/news/boxwood_leafminer_a_serious_pest_of_a_favorite_landscape_plant"

There are many perennials which grow well in the shade: hellebores, hostas, ferns which could go around your hydrangea.\u00a0 This site has shade perennials and shrubs to help you\u00a0\u00a0https://gardening.org/shade-loving-perennials/  Are you planning on planting the new garden in the grassy spot that is visible in the picture?\u00a0 The ground seems to be\u00a0 higher than the sidewalk and driveway.\u00a0 If so, the soil could be dug out or you could put rocks around the edges and build the garden up.\u00a0 I think building up might be easier.\u00a0 If you put cardboard over the grass and throw on leaves and manure and compost during the winter, by spring you should have a nice bed to plant.\u00a0 The cardboard will stop weeds and may even deter the ivy.\u00a0 This type of bed building is called lasagna planting.\u00a0 This site explains it https://growingplaces.org/wp-content/uploads/Lasagna-Gardening.pdf  I'm sure you know that usually the taller plants go in the back of a garden or in the middle of a garden that you can view from different spots.\u00a0 After you choose your shrub and perennials and probably a ground cover (ajuga?), put the pots on the soil and move them around like you'd move furniture inside to see what pleases you the most.\u00a0   Since I am not a garden designer, I'm attaching this link that describes in detail how to create a shady garden. https://ngb.org/create-the-ultimate-shade-garden/  I hope this helps.

These pests, which are the larval form of beetles, feed on the roots of turfgrass, causing extensive damage to lawns.  Regarding the ineffectiveness of imidacloprid this year, there could be several reasons:  Resistance Development: Over time, grubs can develop resistance to insecticides like imidacloprid, making them less effective. More information at this link:  EPA Finalizes Biological Evaluations Assessing Potential Effects of Three Neonicotinoid Pesticides on Endangered Species | US EPA  Application Timing: The insecticide may not be as effective if it is not applied at the right time. Grubs are most vulnerable when they are young and actively feeding near the soil surface.  Environmental Factors: Weather conditions, such as heavy rainfall or drought, can affect the efficacy of imidacloprid. For instance, excessive rain can wash away the insecticide before it has a chance to work. More information at this link:  EPA Finalizes Biological Evaluations Assessing Potential Effects of Three Neonicotinoid Pesticides on Endangered Species | US EPA  Soil Conditions: Soil type and moisture levels can influence how well the insecticide is absorbed and distributed in the soil.

        "text": "You are correct. Black Vine Weevils. The adults notch the leaves, the larvae feed on the roots. The following information is from The Missouri Botanical Garden. The black vine weevil, Otiorhynchus sulcatus, also known as the taxus weevil, feeds on a wide range of ornamental plants but is most destructive in its larval stage to yew, hemlock, rhododendron, and several other broad-leaved evergreens as well as to some greenhouse plants such as asters, cyclamens, and impatiens. As an adult, it has a wide host range to include both deciduous and herbaceous plants. It is the most devastating of the root weevils throughout the northern half of the U.S. and Canada. Symptoms and Diagnosis Adult black vine weevil injury on broad-leaved evergreens and other hosts consists of marginal notching of the leaves. To detect weevil infestations on yew, examine the center of the plant near the main stems for notched and cut-off leaves. This damage is the result of adults feeding at night. The adult is 3/8 to 1/2 inches long, shiny, black, female, and cannot fly. It feeds only at night, and when disturbed, drops to the ground where it is virtually undetectable due to its coloration. Adult feeding rarely causes serious plant injury, however, the characteristic notches provide evidence that the pest is present and action is necessary to mitigate damage by the larva of the next generation. The larva causes the most damage by feeding on the roots and girdling the lower stems, disrupting the flow of nutrients and water through the plant. Its feeding may result in the death of the plant. The larvae are legless, C-shaped, and white with reddish-brown heads. They may be found at a depth of from 3/4 to 16 inches in the soil around the roots. Pupation occurs in the soil near the surface. Pupae are white with very prominent legs and antennae. Life Cycle Partially grown larvae overwinter in the soil. Adults emerge from the soil in late spring and egg-laying begins one to two weeks later. The female lays up to 500 eggs in the soil near the base of the plant over a period of two to three weeks. Larval feeding takes place from midsummer, when the eggs hatch, continues into the fall, and then again in the spring. Occasionally adults overwinter, which complicates the life cycle because eggs are laid earlier. There is usually one generation per year. The most vulnerable stage is the adult. The larvae are much less vulnerable because they are protected by the soil. Integrated Pest Management Strategies 1. Nematodes can be applied as a soil drench to control larval stages of black vine weevil. Several species have been reported to be effective. The nematodes kill by entering the victim's body and reproducing. Two species are commercially available: Steinernema carpocapsae and Heterorhabditis heliothidis. H. heliothidis has been shown to be more effective against the early stages of the weevil at greater soil depths than S. carpocapsae. Nematodes can last three months in the soil, but soil temperature must be above 50 degrees F and the soil must be kept moist for nematode survival. Unfortunately, drenches are less effective under field conditions than in a greenhouse situation.

The white \"dandruff\" you are seeing is the nymphs.\u00a0 Upon closer inspection, you can also see the adults.\u00a0 Their green pear shaped bodies, are almost the same color as the tomato leaves.  Usually a strong blast of water will wash them away and disperse them.\u00a0 You can also clip off badly infested leaves if that's easier.  Alternatively, you can spray with an insecticidal soap or Neem oil.\u00a0 Both of these may require multiple applications.

They will be shedding leaves once you move them inside too.\u00a0 This time of year you don't need to fertilize them more. How much are you watering? With the cooler nights coming, be sure to check the soil moisture before watering to let them dry out some in between. How many hours of direct sun are they receiving? If they are getting too much shade that could be causing the leaf yellowing and dropping too.\u00a0 in Frederick county, you will probably want to bring these inside in about a month. They can handle some cooler nights but probably won't be too happy when the night time temperatures start to be consecutively below 50 degrees. Let us know if you have further questions.\u00a0 Emily"

Salt can be a problem by the street or driveway causing yellowing or burned leaf margins. Since this appears to be universal in your landscape and you feel confident in your watering and planting, a pH or nutrient issue could be to blame.\u00a0 A soil test (Home | MSU Soil Test)\u00a0could validate this. Take a look at the different sections that have the problem and try to determine what they may have in common.\u00a0 \u00a0Are there certain plants that are unaffected?\u00a0 If so, what plants are affected and what is not?\u00a0 Do any of the plants show abnormal growth?\u00a0 What type of soil do you have (sand, clay, loam)?

Plants this size will take 2-3 yers to establish.  Dig down 8-10 inches after you water to see if soil is moist. You want moist soil, not soggy and not dry. Water early in the day so foliage is dry by sunset if you use a sprinkler that wets the needles. It is best to use a soaker hose at the base around both sides of the hedge. A quick connect type makes it easy to leave the hose in place in between waterings. Water these shrubs at least once a week in clay or loamy soils, 2-3 times a week in sandy soils. Water until the ground freezes.\u00a0 Next spring through fall\u00a0water in the same way when no substantial rain is expected that week(3/4- 1 inch of rain). Again, keep the shrubs watered up to when the ground freezes next year.\u00a0 All evergreens need to go into winter well hydrated, but not drowning. A layer of mulch 2-3 inches deep and not touching the trunks or lower foliage will help retain water, discourage weeds, and make it easier to mow around the hedge."

It did worse after the drought this summer. (We are now watering it regularly; kind of like closing the barn door after the horse has left.) We recently noticed webs (circled in red on pictures 2 & 3) on a few of the branches and suspect that they are an indication of spider mites. I tried to get pictures of what might be mites but the pictures were all too blurry to be helpful.  \r\n\r\nWe have read your article (https://extension.umd.edu/resource/spider-mites-trees-and-shrubs/). We are considering spraying them with a hose to wash them off or using predatory mites for management if in fact what we have are spider mites. A concern we have is that near the tree are five Buxus sinica (Franklin's Gem Boxwood) and if we use water we don't want the mites to end up infesting the boxwood. \r\n\r\nDo you have any recommendation about how we should proceed?"

        "speaker": "expert",
        "text": "The webbing pictured is not from spider mites, and there is no spider mite feeding damage (which would be quite prominent for that much webbing to be visible) on the foliage. Instead, the webbing is probably due to spiders, which are beneficial because they prey on insects, or due to caterpillars, but not a type of caterpillar that is a serious pest in need of treatment. (If it were one of those, their communal webbing is much more extensive, and defoliation around the webbing would be prominent, which it is not.)  The dieback in the first photo might be attributed to either drought stress (directly or indirectly as a result of a secondary infection like Botryosphaeria canker, which can take advantage of stressed plants) or from poor pruning cuts. We can't quite tell from the photo because of the distance and the foliage hiding some of the branch stubs, but since it looks like the tree canopy was previously trimmed (to accommodate the power lines?) in a way that reduced the length of some substantial branches, we think the cuts might not have been made in the right location, allowing dieback to progress down the branch. Proper pruning cuts are diagrammed on our Pruning Trees page, which includes a link to a handy video tutorial by Iowa State University. We mention this because, even though it's unrelated to the webbing, the dieback in\u00a0the canopy is significant\u00a0and appears to necessitate more pruning, so we wanted to make sure additional branch removal was done properly to protect the health of the tree. Once wood decay sets in, it can't be treated except to prune it out. If Botryosphaeria is a contributing factor for dieback, affected branches will need to be pruned out since they won't recover.  Catching up on watering is good (even if intervention is a bit late, you're still helping to ensure roots aren't dying), but use caution so it doesn't accidentally turn into\u00a0over-watering, since that will cause similar symptoms to under-watering (wilting, leaf scorch, pre-autumn\u00a0leaf shed, etc.). Feel the soil about six inches deep in the root area and water thoroughly once the soil becomes somewhat dry to the touch at that depth. (If damp at that depth when checked, watering is probably not needed yet.)  Boxwoods can get their own type of mite (\"boxwood mites\"), but while spider mites (like Two-spotted Spider Mites)\u00a0are sometimes generalists, able to feed on a wide variety of plants, we usually don't see them on boxwood. The same environmental conditions promote outbreaks of both, though, so they can appear around the same time. Conditions tend to center around heat and drought. Some cultivars of boxwood are naturally more pest-resistant than others, and in our experience, 'Franklins'\u00a0Gem' does not tend to develop heavy mite damage.  Miri"

I am very pleased to know that we don't have spider mites but instead\u00a0have beneficial insects! Your comments regarding the dieback are very helpful. As a community garden we have volunteers (including me) who often have more enthusiasm than knowledge. Your pruning guidelines are helpful and we will follow them for pruning our other trees. Because of the current condition of the maple we will be paying a registered arborist to do the trimming in February and hope for the best.\u00a0 Your caution about over watering is also helpful. My concern about a lack of past water could easily cause me to over water. I'll check the soil at 6 inches and proceed as you have suggested. With gratitude,Lowell"

The owner put the goat in the block garage, and it never came out into the tiny back yard again. I could hear a bleat a couple of times when it went in. I complained to city codes (Jeramey) and he came out here in spring.\r\nHe will not face the goat guy nor help the goat.

Might inspect for grub damage.\u00a0 I would also closely examine the dying grass blades to see what other issues might be apparent.\u00a0 Is the soil compacted or is there any other issues that may have caused the probem?\u00a0 I will also mention the newer alternatives to lawn turf grass. Turf grass is a sterile environment for nature. Various chemicals applied to the turf grass makes it additionally toxic to our pollinators. Our insects and pollinators are becoming extinct at an amazing rate.

There is also a small amount of leaf darkening or reddening that can also be attributed to environmental stress, possibly from\u00a0drought or high heat. (Leaf reddening during winter is also normal for many azalea varieties, and it's due to similar conditions -- stress from temperature or inaccessible soil moisture -- during that time of year.)\u00a0A location next to a wall can compound summer stress by reducing air circulation, reflecting extra light, and contributing to heat build-up and soil drying.  No management for lace bug needs to be done now, and you can monitor the plant for a new generation of lace bugs next spring. If you intervene, options are included in the page linked above, though usually only a strong spray of plain water from a garden hose or a few treatments of horticultural oil or insecticidal soap are needed to suppress their numbers. Either method must contact the leaf undersides to be effective, as that is where lace bugs will be living and laying their eggs.  Were the azaleas monitored for watering needs this summer?\u00a0If not, start checking them periodically and watering as needed (once the soil becomes somewhat dry to the touch around five inches down) so they can maintain healthy roots and not lose flower buds that have formed for next spring's bloom.  The milkweed discoloration is hard to diagnose, but it does not appear to be due to disease or any pest activity; it too looks like a result of environmental stress. No action needs to be taken, and if nothing else is going on unrelated to the leaf symptoms, then the plant should go dormant as usual later this autumn\u00a0and regrow normally next year. Is this a Swamp Milkweed?\u00a0(It looks like it is.)\u00a0If so, it is growing in moist soil?\u00a0If also affected by drought, the plant's roots would fare better if periodically watered during dry spells.

Too heavy of a mulching can interfere with root health as well as harbor certain pests (in this case, mainly voles that might have chewed into the base of the main stem(s)). A mulch layer should be no more than 3 inches thick over a plant's root zone, and not piled against its main stems or base.\u00a0Our primary suspect in this case, though, is moisture-related...were the junipers being monitored for watering needs during this year's drought (which is still present in parts of the state, including most of Montgomery\u00a0County)? Even though junipers are known for their good tolerance to drought, it is just that -- a tolerance, not a preference -- and they can be pushed over their limits and succumb to damage if the roots get too dry. The drainage or moisture retention between the two planting sites, despite how close to each other they are, could still differ and result in different rates of drying out for each planting. Is either location in competition with any nearby tree roots, even if the shade from that tree isn't overshadowing the junipers?  Fertilizer does not benefit stressed plants, and may actually make the situation worse if a nutrient deficiency in the soil is not the sole reason for plant damage. (It would not be here, given the symptoms you describe.) Established shrubs, junipers included, should also not need routine fertilization.  Junipers should not need regular pruning, though they will tolerate a bit if it's needed to remove errant growth or restrain size a bit (drastic pruning to restrain size is not as well-tolerated and can lead to dieback in certain circumstances). For plants with brown branches, those stems will not recover and will need to be pruned off back to where they join still-living wood. Healthy growth should not need trimming, and any plant wound (even from sharp pruners) does run a risk of becoming infected or colonized by wood decay organisms, so each pruning cut on a shrub or tree should be made with good reason. For junipers with too much brown growth (dieback), or if any plants turned entirely brown, they will need to be removed/replaced instead since they cannot recover. You can replace them with the same variety if you prefer a symmetrical look, and if the site doesn't have conditions (like too much shade or poor drainage) that conflicts with the needs of the juniper. For example, if drought was the primary cause of their demise (our working theory so far), then replanting should be fine.  Miri"

The mulch doesn't appear to be laid too thickly, though it's hard to tell. Soaker hoses can be a great way to water while conserving moisture, but check on them once in a while to make sure they're still functioning normally along their entire length, since sometimes (in a drought especially), thirsty wildlife (rodents or rabbits, mostly)\u00a0might find them and chew into them, making them leak.

Moreover, phosphorous levels are notoriously variable and subject to rapid fluctuations, sometimes on a weekly level.\u00a0\u00a0I think we have to consider\u00a0other possibilities. To assist me in my thinking, I need answers to the following: 1). \u00a0You said that the soil report was from the gold mound area.\u00a0Does this mean you also have a soil report for around the gold flame and just didn\u2019t send it to us? \u00a0Or, does it simply that you only took a soil sample from around the gold mound spirea? 2). \u00a0What is under the rock mulch? \u00a0Specifically, is there any type of plastic covering or landscape fabric? \u00a0 3). \u00a0You indicated that these spireas were planted in May 2022. \u00a0Does this mean that this whole garden area, including the mulch, were also established in May 2022? \u00a0Or had this area and mulch existed prior to May 2022 but other things were planted there? \u00a0if the latter, what was planted there and how did it grow? 4). \u00a0I\u2019m curious about the drainage around the garden. Does water from the sidewalk and adjacent driveway drain into the gold mound area? \u00a0Were\u00a0any deicing compounds used on the sidewalk and/or driveway during the winters of 2022/23 and 2023/24? \u00a0Related to this, when snow is shoveled in the winter, does more snow end up the gold mound area than in\u00a0the gold flame area? 5). \u00a0Does the discharge\u00a0 from the downspout largely flow onto the gold mound spirea? At this time l\u2019m inclined towards thinking that we are looking at some environmental cause rather than a soil problem. I\u2019ll look forward to your responses and additional thoughts.

Typical black woven polypropylene weed barrier fabric - water can penetrate.3. \u00a0Fabric, rock mulch, and shrubs were there for about 20 years. \u00a0The area with gold flame spirea had the same before replacing in 2022. \u00a0The area with the gold mound was originally rose glow barberry but we replaced them about 10 years ago because we didn\u2019t like dealing with the barbs. \u00a0Replaced them with gold mound spirea that did OK for about 7 years and then started dying out before we replaced them in 2022, again with gold mound spirea.4. \u00a0The quarter round section of concrete coming from the entry way and wrapping around to the driveway drains onto the gold mound spirea, primarily the two closest to the driveway. \u00a0Nothing from the driveway drains onto them.Deicing compounds have been used over the past 20 years, sparingly, including winters of 2022.23 and 2023.24. \u00a0Maybe 5 to 7 times each winter. \u00a0I know that even though I did not sprinkle deicer that often there is still salt that would get tracked from the street onto the driveway by the car and that can be picked up when removing snow. \u00a0In the early years I was not careful when removing snow and it would get piled onto the gold mound spirea, with the heaviest load on the two closest to the driveway. \u00a0But in the last 3-5 years I have been careful to pile the snow past the edge of mulch and away from the gold mound spirea.I thought about one other thing that I use to do, but that I stopped doing in the past 3 or more years. \u00a0I would wash the cars on the driveway. \u00a0All the car wash solution would flow down the driveway, none flowed directly onto the gold mound spirea. \u00a0However, if I had some extra wash solution in my bucket I would pour it over the gold mound spirea, with the two closest to the driveway getting the most of it. \u00a0There was typically less than a gallon left so probably only or quart or so poured over each of them. \u00a0This would only have been about 7 times, 10 max, over spring through fall. \u00a0A data sheet regarding the ingredients in a typical car wash solution I used is attached.I stopped doing both the snow removal dumping and the car wash leftover dumping around the same time because I wondered if it contributed to the die out of the gold mound spirea.5. \u00a0No. \u00a0The discharge drains first to the edge of the landscape rock mulch just between the second and third gold flame spirea. \u00a0If it is a heavy rain, the discharge will flow along the mulch edge and pool at the very edge of the mulch below the better gold mound spirea and the middle gold mound spirea.Thank you,JoeOn Sep 14, 2024, at 3:44\u202fPM, Ask Extension wrote:"

        "text": "Thanks for your last response. I think that we can conclude certain things regarding your spirea: 1). While fabric cloth can impede the passage of water to the roots of plants, this does not appear to have affected the growth of the gold flame.\u00a0 Also, previously you had gold mound spirea that seemed unaffected for seven years. While not the best situation, I don\u2019t believe that the presence of the landscaping fabric can explain the current state of your gold mound spirea. 2). There did not appear anything out of the ordinary in your soil analysis. Also and although you did not sample the soil underlying them, the gold flame spirea are doing well. I doubt that the existing soil is causing issues with the gold mound spirea. 3). With the three gold mound spirea, one is marginal whereas the other two do not look good. This may reflect differences in how they were planted. My recommendations: 1). Do not add any fertilizer to the spirea this fall. Keep watering them on a very frequent basis up until the ground is frozen. Try to keep them from being buried under snow from the sidewalk and driveway.  2). I am reasonably confident that the innermost gold mound spirea will come through the winter in reasonable shape. I would expect that additional foliage will develop on it. If the other two gold mound do not show improvement by late May 2025, they should be replaced. 3). All the spirea should be fertilized in late May 2025 with a tree and shrub fertilizer having a 10-10-10 composition. Please get back to me if you have additional, related questions. Thanks for consulting with us."

The only situation that might be concerning is if, after a few days of sitting on the shelf, the syrup started actively creating new bubbles. That would be a sign of fermentation in the fruit. Best practice is always to \"debubble\" your jars before affixing the lid. You can do this by running a plastic knife or chop stick around the inside of the jar, slightly nudging the fruit to release trapped air bubbles. This helps reduce the number of bubbles in the final jar and ensures proper headspace. Hot packing your fruit, by briefly simmering it in syrup before packing it in jars, also helps to drive air out of the fruit tissues before canning.\u00a0 In short, no safety concerns with small bubble in your cans of plums aa day after canning. If you see active bubbling after a day or two more, then you might have fermentation going on and need to dispose of the product. Thanks for reaching out with your question! Jared"

Yes, these nests can build for month before they are noticed.\u00a0  A few things about yellowjacket biology may be useful here (and yes, the black and white bald-faced \"hornets\" are just another species of yellowjacket).\u00a0First, the nests are not perennial, they are annual. In fact, the nest is now reaching its peak population and should begin crashing within a month. The colony should be completely dead by November.\u00a0  If you cannot avoid the nest until it collapses you will need to kill the nest. Given its height, I would recommend bringing in a pest control professional. To do it yourself would involve climbing a ladder and spraying an insecticide formulated for yellowjacket control into the entrance of the colony (which is the hole at the bottom of the nest). There is a risk that the yellowjackets could fly out at you while on the ladder, causing you to loose balance and fall.\u00a0  There is a great (out of print) University of Idaho Extension document that goes over your options.

In my experience an application of a pyrethroid-based insecticide like the one you list should work with a single application. Read the instructions on the label carefully. I am looking at an example of this product label (which may differ from the one you have) and it does warn not being directly under the nest, as you will be dispensing a large volume that could potentially drip back on you. Also note the label specifies watching the wind conditions (although in the enclosed space, the risk of wind may be minimal) as it could cause the spray to drift back onto you. Applying at sunset is recommended on the label and the wasps will be less active (but not totally inactive). Make sure to have a plan to get into cover if the wasps to fly off the nest (i.e., think about where you will go if there are wasps flying around, ideally through a door you can close or into dense shrubbery). It would be prudent as well to let someone else in the household know when you are making the application who you can check-in\u00a0with.

We first saw the mold 7 days after putting seed down. The seed is covered with a thin (1/8 - 1/4'') Peat Moss that we applied with a roller, which in turn is covered by a thin layer of EZ Straw. We've watered for 5-7 minutes per area when it appears \"dry\" and not more than 2X/day. There are very large and mature trees on the property which does limit the amount of sun some of these areas get. We also have a lot of sloping grades on the property, so water flow is a challenge and some areas of the yard do seem to stay wetter than others for longer periods of time. It appears the mold is growing on the Peat Moss itself, not the newly developing blades of grass. We did note, however, that some parts (sometimes tip, sometimes the base next to the ground) of the grass blades are dark brown in color. In researching this, we read that Peat Moss can at times develop Trichoderma and other types of saprophytic fungi so are wondering if that's what we are seeing, as the blades themselves do not seem to have mold on them - although it is hard to tell as we're hesitant to walk onto the turf to get close enough to confirm, given it's only been 8 days since planting and the grass appears quite delicate. Could you please take a look at the attached photos\u00a0and let us know if you think this could be Pythium, Trichoderma or something else - and advise on what we should do to control this? The photos show two affected areas, with the first two photos being a further back shot to show the overall shape of the fungus followed a close-up of the spores.\u00a0 The last photo is of\u00a0 second affected area. Thank you!"

They have grown happily and healthily until about two years ago, when one became ill.  We had Bartlett Tree Experts look at it, and they declared apple blight, and applied a treatment.  Things continued to go downhill, with one tree dying completely and the other ailing.  Bartlett looked again and said the problem was inadequate watering.  So we stepped up watering to their recommendations (though we were a bit suspicious of this diagnosis since we have been watering steadily, and had no issues for the first 18 years or so).  This did not work and now we have two dead trees.  We can ask Bartlett for a post-mortem, but given their track record, would like a second opinion.  Which leads to my question, assuming we dig up and replace the trees.  Do we need to REPLACE the soil?  Given we don't know exactly what killed the trees, is there any illness they could have had which leaves bacteria or whatever in the soil, such that replacement seedlings would also die, and soon?  In which case, we would not just plant new trees, but remove X cubic yards of soil and replace it, first.  Thank you very much!"

        "text": "Greetings, Glenn, and thank you for your question to AskExtension/Ask a Master Gardener. You must be heartbroken over the loss of your espaliered apple trees. I am guessing they were magnificent. (I would love to see a picture of them in their prime!) I cannot definitively diagnose the issue with your trees, and therefore can\u2019t determine whether or not soil replacement is recommended, but I can give you some information, guidance and suggestions that will hopefully help you decide on the best course.  You wrote that the company initially diagnosed \u201capple blight\u201d. I have not been able to locate any information about \"apple blight\" in research-based publications, but I can make an educated guess that they were referring to \u201cFire Blight\u201d (FB), a bacterial disease that attacks apple, pear and other plants in the Rosaceae family, and which is common in Ohio. Once a tree is infected with FB, it is very difficult to successfully treat. This article from Ohio State\u2019s Ohioline and this article from Penn State Extension will give you more information. Trees with FB often exhibit a tell-tale \u201cshepherd\u2019s crook\u201d on new growth, which may help in diagnosis. The bacteria do not live freely in soil, so if all branches, leaves and cankers were removed before replanting, new trees would not be infected from the soil. (See here.) However, if there are other nearby plants that have the FB bacteria, it could be spread to replacement trees by wind, insects or pruning. A recommendation would be to choose apple trees resistant to the Fire Blight bacteria. The Ohioline article referenced above has a list of resistant rootstocks and tree varieties. Another possibility is that they meant Botrytis blight, which is a fungal infection that affects many plants, including apple trees. It is less lethal to trees than FB (1.5/5.0), but the fungus can remain in the soil for about three years. Soil can be treated with fungicides, although that can have a detrimental effect on soil health, as beneficial fungi will also be destroyed.  Recommendations:  - If the trees have not yet been removed, my recommendation would be to send a sample to the PPDC (Plant and Pest Diagnostic Clinic) at The Ohio State University. You may submit either physical or photographic samples, but in your case a physical specimen would be best. There is a small fee of about $20. (Please note that we do not receive any proceeds from recommending this service.) Directions for submitting a sample can be found here. If they can make a definite diagnosis, you will have better information for preparation of your soil. - It might also help you to have a professional soil sample analysis. It will give you excellent information moving forward. You can find all you need to know here. - Choose replacement trees resistant to Fire Blight, as noted above.   In preparing a response to your question, I referred to research-based sites to ensure that my response was accurate and timely. If you are interested in learning more about this topic, the best of those sites are embedded in the text and/or listed below. Wishing you the very best in replanting your beloved espaliered apple trees! (I am assuming you plan to espalier the replacements?) If you need any clarification, or if you have further questions on this topic, please feel free to contact me; if you reply to this email, it will come directly to me. I would love to hear from you!

Both trees are still holding up okay (one seems to have recovered somewhat from the last couple seasons of bad droughts and rains) but I\u2019ve been trying and failing to propagate them for several years, and it looks like I may lose access to them in the next year or so (at which point I don\u2019t know what will happen to them). The trees currently have several cones growing, and I was hoping to get in contact with someone who had experience propagating these seeds, as I\u2019ve read everything I could find online, but haven\u2019t had much luck in practice. I\u2019ve tried propagating them from both cuttings and seed (I got one to germinate but I over-watered the seedling) and I\u2019m worried about what else I don\u2019t know.\r\n\r\nI know this is probably an odd request, but these trees have a lot of sentimental value to me and I\u2019d really love to be able to keep them going somehow, even if I can\u2019t protect the big ones forever.

You might have to resort to the techniques that they use up in Estes or other areas by using fencing/caging around the plants.  You can try to clean up the torn areas by cutting away the loose shards (do not cut into the branch or new tissues). Some of the branches may not survive because of the extensive damage.  Going forward, focus efforts on regular watering, including in fall and winter. This will help the trees seal off the wounds and recover better - and support overall growth. Keep grass/weeds clear at the base of the trees and add mulch, if possible. Keep the mulch away from the trunk.\u00a0  Also, can the ponderosa support itself without the stake? The green tape is flexible but can cut into the trunk and cause a constriction, which affects the flow of water and nutrients. If possible, remove the green tape and the stake."

Management hinges upon stopping their spread, and there are some methods that can be somewhat effective.\u00a0Now that your area is known to be infested, avoid moving soil/plants from there to other areas. Tools/boots/tires used in that area should have all the\u00a0soil removed from them\u00a0before being used in new areas.\u00a0Hand-pickingCollecting and killing the worms on sight is an option, albeit labor-intensive. Worms that are caught can be left in the sun for several hours to kill them. Once dead, the worms can be disposed of without fear of spreading them to new areas.\u00a0 To make hand-picking easier, use a mustard pour (which is totally harmless to plants). Mix\u00a0a gallon of water with 1/3 cup of ground yellow mustard seed and pour slowly into the soil. This will drive any worms to the surface where you can easily remove them.Soil SolarizationUsing a clear plastic tarp, completely envelop soil and leave it in the sun so the mass reaches at least 104\u00b0F for at least three days Let me know if you have further questions."

Leaf composting Regarding mulch, the amount you are planning should work well. The following fact sheet provides additional information about growing strawberries, including mulching.

This has unfortunately been a hot topic here at the Infoline over the last two weeks.\u00a0It is difficult to clearly identify the sole problem but based on how some of the leaves appear to have brown spots it is possible that the lilacs have Lilac Bacterial Blight. This is a useful resource for this: http://plantclinic.cornell.edu/factsheets/lilacbacterialblight.pdf Make sure that if you fertilize your lilacs, don\u2019t overfertilize and stop fertilizing all together around mid-summer because elevated levels of nitrogen in the soil can lead to more favorable conditions for the disease. We recommend testing the soil to check the pH and nutrient balance. The UNH Extension also has these services for $20 per test and you can find the form here.  Infected branches should be pruned 10-12 inches below the visible infection as soon as you see indications of disease. Pruning should be done during dry weather to minimize the chance of spreading the pathogen and if you are pruning your bushes late in the summer, make as few cuts as possible. The act of pruning sends a signal to the plant to grow and at this time of the year that can lead winter damage on tender new shoots. Pruned branches should be destroyed, ideally by burning. Always sterilize pruning tools between cuts to prevent spreading the bacterium to other areas on the tree.  You could also submit a sample to the UNH Extension Plant Diagnostic Lab for $20 to get a more definitive determination of the issue and ways to treat it. The submission form with directions is found here. Good luck with your lilac! Please reach out if you have any other questions and have a great rest of your week!"

Since Christa has forwarded me a lot of questions recently :), I wanted to turn the tables and ask my own question.\r\n\r\nI have a large, 30+ year old stand of hydrangeas.  Aside from being able to tell they are macrophylla, I have no identifying info about them.\r\nThey had performed well for many years, but starting a couple of years ago they would leaf out in the spring but never flower.  Frustrated by this, last fall I had the crew that mows my lawn cut down all the dead stalks in the fall.  Voila, as shown in the photo, this year they flowered beautifully.  But then all the flowers and foliage turned brown and fell off--they never did that before.  In the last few weeks, they have started to green up again.  As shown in the photos, the greening is mostly near the bottom but in some places mid-way up on otherwise dead-looking stalks.\r\n\r\nQuestion:  should I cut back the stalks again?  If so, where should I cut them, just above emerging leaves, or lower down, a foot or so above the ground?  Or should I leave everything be and only cut back stalks next spring once I am sure nothing is growing on them?  Do you have any idea why the plants lost all their foliage after flowering?  Are they perhaps near the end of their useful life?\r\n\r\nThanks, Bob"

Be sure to check the link for managing your emotions because this issue does produce heightened emotions. They are awful! You can Solarize your leaf litter to kill any adults and eggs living there. Do not compost at home as your small pile will not get hot enough to kill the eggs.\u00a0 If you purchase mulch ask them how they store it to manage jumping worms. Try experimenting with a living much such as grasses or ground covers.\u00a0 Don\u2019t share plants from your garden with others or transport your soil. Clean your boots or shoes after you have been walking in your garden.\u00a0 Remember that they are annual.

        "text": "Do you have an extensive infestation of your conifers that the arborist felt needed to be treated? Typically, pitch mass borer does not negatively effect the overall health of a pine tree. However, as with most things \"it depends\"--on overall health of the tree, if another disease moves in, etc.\u00a0 It might be that your arborist applied treatment too late in the season. Here is a link to a question similar to yours from a couple years ago. \" Pitch mass borers are more difficult to control, but injection of emamectin benzoate should provide protection for 2 - 3 years. There is generally only one larva in each pitch mass, so it is possible to dig through the mass and locate the larva, if there are only a few masses and the are within safe reach. It typically takes a tree 2 - 3 weeks to take up an insecticide administered by injection. Make sure there is adequate soil moisture to ensure uptake. You don't want the soil saturated, but it has to be moist for the tree to take up the product. There are several different pitch mass borers each with their own lifecycle. Because we don't know which one(s) you have, it is not possible to know whether it is too late to apply the insecticide. It is definitely too late to apply a preventative trunk spray, but the systemic insecticide will spread throughout the tree tissue that the larvae are feeding on, and kill any that are still actively feeding. It will also protect the tree for 2 - 3 years. Please note that pitch mass borers tend to attack trees that are already stressed. To best help your trees, take measures to reduce stress as possible. Consider applying 2-3 inches of mulch, such as pine needles or wood chips, under the tree starting several inches out from the trunk and extending to the drip line. Mulch will help conserve moisture during dry conditions and reduce temperature swings in the soil. If possible, irrigate deeply (1 inch of water) once per week during prolonged hot, dry conditions\u2014but do not overwater, as this will also stress the tree. You might also consider applying a low rate of nitrogen fertilizer (1 lb N per 1,000 sq ft) under the tree canopy, or spread evenly around the drip line of the tree. Fertilizer should be watered in, or spread before rain is expected. You could consider getting a soil test, which would let you know the soil pH and whether there are any nutrients lacking:\u00a0https://homesoiltest.msu.edu/\" According to the University of Massachusetts Amherst \"Pitch can be removed and the single larva within destroyed. Physical/mechanical management of this insect, if it can be safely done, is a great way to manage the pitch mass borer on individual specimen trees. The act of just pulling the caterpillar from its pitch mass will kill it.\" You might try this technique on any masses of pitch you can reach. If you can find active borers in the pitch, you know the treatment did not work. (It may be that the tree is still \"bleeding\" from the damage borers and needs time to close off the wounds.)\u00a0I'm not sure if this video link will work for you, but it shows what the larva looks like and how easy it can be to find it (it's not always this easy--sometimes you need to poke around in the tree with something like a coat hanger wire).\u00a0 It is suggested that pruning conifers during the warmer months attracts pitch mass borer moths to your trees, so make sure you only prune in dormant months."

I'm sure I disconvered this new spot I sent you the pic of.\u00a0 \u00a0I also sent in a soil sample last year and was pretty low on potassium, needed some nitrogen and possibly sulfer so I had the arborist do deep root feeding to all the trees last fall , Oct 31. In the spring the trees were treated as follows:   We performed the following: Insect & Disease Spring Spray\u00a0-\u00a0\u00a0(view invoice) \u00a0(view detailed report) Technician: Hunter Cook \u00a0-\u00a0Temperature: 61\u00b0 \u00a0-\u00a0Wind Speed: 4 NW Today, your plants received an active and preventative insect and disease treatment. Multiple treatments are needed each season to prevent infestation and pest resistance. Products Used: \u00a06.00 Fluid Oz - Chlorothalonil 720 SFT \u00a09.00 Fluid Oz - Imidacloprid 2F Insecticide \u00a01.20 Fluid Oz - Nufilm Sticker-Spreader \u00a03.00 Fluid Oz - Tebuconazole 3.6F   treatments began on 4/30 and again on 5/22, 6/7, 7/17.   all my trees were treated including the two canadian hemlocks which I had sent pictures and questions on last year to MSU and they thought the trees might have fabrella needle blight. I'm hoping I've not been throwing money away but I have many full grown in the yard and would hate to start losing them.\u00a0 I'm still getting some yellowing on the hemlocks.   Its been hard finding an arborist and I had 3 come out early last year, each giving me different recommendations for treatment!\u00a0 that's when I sent the info off to MSU and forwarded your reports to the arborist I ended up choosing.   I have a bag of 13-13-13 granular fertilizer.\u00a0 Should I go ahead and put it under the trees again this year after frost?\u00a0 I will also get more potash to toss down - can I also do that after frost? many thanks, Nancy \u00a0           From: ask=<personal data hidden> on behalf of Ask Extension  Sent: Monday, September 9, 2024 10:35 AM To: Nancy E Vogrin  Subject: Re: Pine tree with weeping sap spots (#0154415)"

Of note is that many of your conifers are not native to SE Michigan. They are stressed by the different climate and soils from where they evolved and it makes them more susceptible to diseases and pests. We are losing Colorado blue spruces across SE Michigan. As you drive, look at the trees in people's yards. You will see that spruces are on decline.\u00a0 I suspect that your trees will decline and ultimately succumb to these disease pressures. It is up to you whether you want to keep treating them and get a few additional years out of them. I\u00a0would suggest looking at planting replacement trees\u00a0now, so that when these conifers come down, you have trees ready to take their place (I would not recommend replacing them with conifers, since they are not doing well now)."

Unfortunately, the insecticide, Imidacloprid, is not effective against the larval stages of moths, including Zimmerman pine moth and pitch mass borers. It is unlikely to have the desired effect.\u00a0As noted previously, these insects do not generally harm the tree, though they may if numbers are large enough.\u00a0 To my knowledge, tebuconazole is not labeled for needlecast and I am unclear why they applied it, unless there is something else they are trying to treat.\u00a0Chlorothalonil is the appropriate product for needlecast, and should be applied when needles are half expanded, and again 3 - 4 weeks later when needles are fully expanded, for blue spruce. I did not check needle expansion for the dates listed, but I would guess the chlorothalonil timing was reasonable. The appropriate time to apply fertilizer is in the spring around the time the trees begin to resume growth. Organic fertilizers are applied in the fall, because they take several months to break down into a form plants can take up. Regular (inorganic) fertilizers like your 13-13-13 are readily available to plants as soon as they are watered in. Fall application results in loss of much of the fertilizer over the winter. Take care!"
